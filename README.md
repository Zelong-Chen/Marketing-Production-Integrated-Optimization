# Marketing-Production-Integrated-Optimization

## Abstract 
In this project we seek to integrate Marketing predictions with Production optimizations into a single model. Normally Production optimization optimizes based on the predicted sales from Marketing predictions. However, it does not consider the uncertainty that arises from these predictions. By integrating both Marketing predictions with Production optimizations into a single model, we can then incorporate the uncertainty from Marketing predictions into Production optimizations. Thus, decrease the bias in optimization and optimize to the true optimal value. In addition, we will include a validation process that will confirm the decisions made by our models.
